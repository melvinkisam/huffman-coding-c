IMPORTANT!

-   The input file SHOULD NOT contain characters of '1' and '0'
    since there is a problem with how the encoder and decoder programs work.

-   The encoder program produces three outputs: 
        "filename.txt", "filename.txt.hcodebook", "filename.txt.metadata".
    Please only refer to the file that ends with ".txt" for decoding and
    any other input text file should ends with ".txt".

-   Input from console will output an encoded text file called "encoded_text.txt".
